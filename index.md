## Grading

For the most part, we would prefer to teach this course without grades.
What a wonderful concept, learning for learning sake! However, even
though we can\'t change the \"system\" overnight, we can create grading
policies that support learning as much as possible. The various course
activities will contribute to your grade as follows:

{:.table .table-striped}
| Activity | Percentage of Total Grade |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Weekly homework | 60% |
| Review others' homework | 20% |
| Attendance & participation | 20% |

{:#overview .bg-primary .text-light .p-3 .mb-3}
## Overview

The course catalog entry for **CS302**:

> Discussion and review of research and practice relating to the
> teaching of computer science: knowledge organization and
> misconceptions, curriculum and topic organization, evaluation,
> collaborative learning, technology use, and administrative issues. As
> part of a semester-long project to design a computer science course,
> participants invent and refine a variety of homework and exam
> activities, and evaluate alternatives for textbooks, grading and other
> administrative policies, and innovative uses of technology.

In our own words, CS302 is very probably the last professional
development related to teaching you\'ll ever receive, and the
preparation before running your own class. Our meta-goal is to prepare
you fully for that position. Though the syllabus and breadth of content
for your course is set, we will dive into effectively organizing your
course content, delivering lectures and information to students, and
managing administration. How does the entirely online setting change
staff mentoring and resource access? Ultimately, our goal is to prepare
you for the coming summer.

This course is one of the requirements for the graduate teaching minor
and a requirement for teaching in the summer session. The course is 3
units, graded.

We hope that you will leave CS302 with every question you\'ve ever had
about the teaching side of faculty life answered, and feel confident
you\'d be able to start your academic career with the wheels spinning,
pointed squarely down the center of the road to success.

**Goals and Class Norms**

It is our intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and
perspectives be well-served by this course, that students\' learning
needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that
students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and
benefit. It is our intent to present materials and activities that are
respectful of diversity: gender, sexual orientation, disability, age,
socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, culture, perspective, and other
background characteristics. Your suggestions about how to improve the
value of diversity in this course are encouraged and appreciated. Please
let us know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you
personally or for other students or student groups.

**Mental Health and Wellness**

As a student you may experience a range of issues that can cause
barriers to learning, such as strained relationships, increased
anxieproblems, depression, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of
motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to
diminished academic performance or reduce a student\'s ability to
participate in daily activities. UC offers services to assist you with
addressing these and other concerns you may be experiencing. If you or
someone you know are suffering from any of the aforementioned
conditions, consider utilizing the confidential mental health services
available on campus. We encourage you to reach out to the [Counseling
Center](https://uhs.berkeley.edu/caps) for support. An on campus
counselor or after-hours clinician is available 24/7.

The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is a 24-hour number any student
or faculty/staff person can call to speak with someone about suicide:
(800) 273-TALK (8255).

**Accommodation**

UC Berkeley is committed to creating a learning environment that meets
the needs of its diverse student body including students with
disabilities. If you anticipate or experience any barriers to learning
in this course, please feel welcome to discuss your concerns with the
instructors.

If you have a disability, or think you may have a disability, you can
work with the Disabled Students\' Program (DSP) to request an official
accommodation. Thed Students\' Program (DSP) is the campus office
responsible for authorizing disability-related academic accommodations,
in cooperation with the students themselves and their instructors. You
can find more information about DSP, including contact information and
the application process [here](https://dsp.berkeley.edu).

**Land Statement**

We recognize that Berkeley sits on the territory of Huichin, the
ancestral and unceded land of the Chochenyo Ohlone, the successors of
the historic and sovereign Verona Band of Alameda County. This land was
and continues to be of great importance to the Ohlone people. We
recognize that every member of the Berkeley community has, and continues
to benefit from the use and occupation of this land, since the
institution\'s founding in 1868. Consistent with our values of community
and diversity, we have a responsibility to acknowledge and make visible
the university\'s relationship to Native peoples. By offering this Land
Acknowledgment, we affirm Indigenous sovereignty and will work to hold
University of California Berkeley more accountable to the needs of
American Indian and Indigenous peoples.
